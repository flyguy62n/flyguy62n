### Thanks for stopping by ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for ingdulging me in quick note about myself...

Pilot, cyclist, nerd.  That about sums it up.  The pilot part -- 62N is the ending part of my airplane's tail number.  She's a 1968 VTail Bonanza.  Super fast, and super cool.  I can be found bouncing around the American Southeast many weekends.

Cyclist -- Lots of road cycling.  With my legs.  Any weekend when I get to both fly and go for a 60-mile (100km) ride is a /really/ /good/ weekend.

Nerd -- I've been in a IT for more than 30 years and have been focused on infosec for more than 25.  And there's my [www.home-assistant.io/](Home Assistant)-automated home.  And then there's [/flyguy62/PIIDigger/](PIIDigger) -- a project I've had in mind for a long time and finally have enough Python skills to even think about it.
